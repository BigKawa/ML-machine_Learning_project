# League of Legends Match Outcome Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict the outcomes of League of Legends matches based on early game data. It demonstrates a machine learning pipeline with data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Project Overview

The primary goal is to classify which team (blue or red) will win based on various metrics collected from the first 15 minutes of gameplay. The dataset contains various metrics, such as gold, kills, towers, and levels for both teams.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from Kaggle, containing features such as:

- `blueWins`, `redWins`: Binary indicators of team victory
- Various team statistics: total gold, current gold, minion kills, ward placements, and others.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Requirements**: Python packages used include:
   - `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation
   - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations

   To install these dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Dataset Download**: You may need to configure Kaggle API access to download the dataset directly. Ensure Kaggle API keys are set up in your environment.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

   - Load the dataset and examine the columns and initial rows to understand feature distributions.
   - Perform data cleaning if necessary (e.g., handling missing values or encoding categorical variables).

### 2. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Apply normalization or scaling to features where appropriate to improve model performance.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

   - Multiple machine learning models, including `RandomForestClassifier` and `LogisticRegression`, are trained and evaluated.
   - The primary metric for evaluation is accuracy, but additional metrics like F1 score and confusion matrix are also calculated.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

   The notebook includes a section for hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` to optimize model parameters. Key parameters tuned include:
   - Number of estimators and max depth for `RandomForest`
   - Regularization parameter (`C`) for `LogisticRegression`

   Example tuning setup:
   ```python
   param_grid = {
       'rf__n_estimators': [50, 100, 150],
       'rf__max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
       'log_reg__C': [0.1, 1, 10],
       'final_estimator__C': [0.1, 1, 10]
   }
   ```

## Results

The notebook outputs the following key metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Model accuracy on the test dataset.
- **F1 Score**: Weighted F1 score for model performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into true positives, false positives, and errors for each class.

## Hardware Considerations

The training and tuning process duration depends on your hardware specifications. For faster tuning, consider:
- Reducing parameter grid size
- Using `RandomizedSearchCV` instead of `GridSearchCV`
- Sampling a subset of the data for preliminary tests

## Future Improvements

- Additional feature engineering to capture important game patterns
- Exploring deep learning models (if computational resources allow)
- Real-time prediction integration in a live environment
